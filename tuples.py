# tuples are IMMUTABLE (it cannot be changed or modified)

coordinates = (4, 5)
print(coordinates[1])

# difference between tuples and lists
# list is with [] --> mutable
# tuple is with () --> immutable (you use it for data that is never going to change)

# list of tuples:
coordinates = [(4, 5), (6, 7), (90, 34)]
